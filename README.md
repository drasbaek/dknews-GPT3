@MinaAlmasi & @drasbaek

### Content overview
- **code** (contains all code files from this investigation both for fine-tuning GPT-3, building classifiers and analyzing experimental results)
- **test-data** (contains file with the 96 test articles from both experiments and how they were classified)

### Dataset of scraped news articles
- For copyright reasons, the dataset for training the machine classifiers is not publicly available on this GitHub repository. For more information about this, please write mina.almasi@post.au.dk or 202008161@post.au.dk

### Fine-Tuned BERT Model 
Our trained classifier for detecting synthetic news is available on the *Hugging Face Hub* on this link:
